Single inheritance 
====================
-> One class is sending their properties to another single class.Iit is called single inheritance.
-> In Single inheritance, child class inherit the features of one Parent class, it is called 
   single inheritance.(Child class inherit the properties of Parent class)


Hierarchical Inheritance 
=====================
-> One parent class is share  its to multiple child classes, it is called Hierarchical inheritance.
   In Hierarchical Inheritance multiple child classes inherit one parent class properties, It is 
   called Hierarchical Inheritance. 

Multilevel Inheritance
======================
-> One class inherit another class and that class inherit another one class. It is called 
   multilevel inheritance.
-> In this inheritance child class inherit parent class properties and parent class inherit 
   grandparent class properties, It is like a chain type inheritance, child class extending 
   Parent class and Parent class extending GrandParent class properties. it is called 
   Multilevel inheritance.

Multiple Inheritance
====================
-> Multiple Parent classes is sending their properties to single Child classes.
   It is called Multiple Inheritance. In Java Multiple Inheritance is not supported.

Hybrid Inheritance - 
=====================
-> Combination of any 2 inheritance is called hybrid inheritance. java does not support it.

Cyclic Inheritance
==================
Extending the properties of same class, it is meaningless. It is called Cyclic inheritance. 
Java does not support it.
